**Brief History**  
Kammu rose to prominence as head of the Nure-Onna, a vampire faction bent on reviving ancient yokai bloodlines. Initially willing to negotiate with the party, he revealed the existence of a rogue splinter group and [[Shimmer]] labs. After a failed alliance and escalating tensions, he was targeted in a coordinated assault by the PCs and the [[Inunaki]] in the [[Night of Raids]]. He escaped but lost an arm to [[B-ma]] in the process. Now on the run and weakened, Kammu remains a dangerous figure with deep connections and grudges.
