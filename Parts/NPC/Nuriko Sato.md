Investigative journalist for the supernatural.

**Relationships**  
Rivalry and reluctant alliance with [[Ga-eul]] â€” professional tension and shared secrets.

Agreed to provide helicopter access in exchange for dirt and favors. Keeps a mystical notebook, and remains deeply tied to old magical networks. Cynical, strategic, and always ten steps ahead.
