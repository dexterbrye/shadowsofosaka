**Rave at the Mozu Kofun**

- The session starts at a rave hosted by [[DJ Shogetsu]] at the [[Mozu Kofun]]. The group describes their rave outfits, earning them easy entry.
- Inside, pulsing neon-lit graffiti hangs in the air, [[DJ Shogetsu]] plays atop an ancestral mound, an out-of-place [[Osaka Metropolitan University]] professor dances, and dealers with [[Nure-Onna]] tattoos lurk in the corner.

**Key Interactions**

- [[Mizuki]] casually approaches the dealers, learning they are vampires who accept blood or money for shimmer.
- [[Yui]] notices [[DJ Shogetsu]]'s ethereal presence in a neon kimono with shimmering, color-changing skin.
- [[Quinn]] hits the bar, chatting with [[Barnum]], a sly bar imp and agent for [[DJ Shogetsu]]. He’s curious about their presence, as they weren’t on the guest list.
- [[Quinn]] inquires about shimmer, but [[Barnum]] claims he "gets high on life," ending the conversation.

**Side Events**

- [[Yui]] rescues [[Erikson]] from vampires. He teaches Lost Western Literature and has helped [[Yui]] find books before. He mentions [[Eggleston]] of the [[Conclave of the Dragon's Heart|Conclave]] and the [[Taproom of the Eye]], inviting [[Yui]] to a meeting.
- [[Mizuki]] trades blood for shimmer, deepening her debt to the [[Nure-Onna]]. She hears the name [[Kammu]].
- [[Quinn]] confronts [[Mizuki]], who denies obtaining shimmer. [[Quinn]] uses faerie magic to get a free sample.

**Barnum’s Offer**

- [[Barnum]] suggests they can meet [[DJ Shogetsu]] if they remove a [[Shoki Aspirants]] monk, [[Natsu]], who is meditating loudly and "harshing the vibe."
- [[Natsu]] is here to protect the [[Mozu Kofun]] from desecration. He declines their approach.

**Escalation**

- A punk with a [[Nure-Onna]] chest tattoo accuses [[Quinn]] of stealing his drugs. She corrects his terminology, attracting vampire thugs.
- [[Natsu]] offers a way out through the tombs. The group scatters:
    - [[Yui]] goes stealth mode but drops a lock of [[Minako]]’s hair she carried.
    - [[Quinn]] glamours herself to avoid detection.
    - [[Mizuki]] flies out "on a wing and a prayer."

**Police Raid**

- [[Yui]] walks into a police cordon during a raid. With no evidence against her, they take her details and let her go.

**Morning Recap**

- [[Yui]] confirms [[Erikson]]'s safety with [[The Beast]], and the group discusses their next steps.
- [[Quinn]] discovers a phone number from [[Barnum]] in her pocket. [[Quinn]]'s brother informs her the dead fae was a court messenger who stole from the Queen.
- [[Mizuki]] mentions [[Kammu]], whom [[Yui]] recognizes as a violent actor from the [[Bonsai War]].

**Meeting with Kammu**

- The group decides to return the shimmer to [[Kammu]] as a peace offering. [[Barnum]] arranges a meeting in a lecture hall [[Yui]] secures.
- [[Kammu]] arrives with goons, demanding to know why he shouldn’t kill them.
