### Session 12: “Suck My Dick, Mizuki”

### Investigations & Leads

- Yui consults [[Oki]] about [[The Beast]], hoping to understand more. Oki needs more information on the Beast's original construction. Yui suggests seeking out [[Yakov]] for answers.
- Ga-eul discovers that the spirit of [[Ikumi Takatasuchi]], daughter of the ghostly samura [[Lord Takatasuchi]], is bound to her father's sword. The sowrd is soon to be acquired by the [[Conclave of the Dragon's Heart|Conclave]] at the [[Onibaba Market]].

### Midnight rendezvous

- Yui and, reluctantly, Mizuki are determined to keep the urn out of [[Shuten-doji]]’s hands, fearing he’ll use it to ascend to godhood.
- The [[Beppu Ka]] are rapidly growing in influence—more people fall into their debt daily.
- Yui checks her stash at the store - the urn is still hidden. She retrieves it. [[Yakov]] is also after it.
- The crew meets [[Yakov]] at a midnight rendezvous. A location he frequents every night. Because immortals have nothing better to do.
- Yui admits that [[Yasha]] has compromised the bookstore and the urn's hiding place.
- Suddenly, Mizuki is forcefully invoked to [[Shuten-doji]]. Yasha appears in Mizuki's place, flanked by demonic minions, demanding the urn.
- Yakov begins to act. Ga-eul stops him. She spots a fish-shaped lantern above, primed to fall.
- Mizuki talks to Yui on Yasha’s phone, offering the urn in exchange for clearing her debts.
- Yui: “Hey Mizuki? Suck my dick.”
- Yui pretends to give in, pulling out the urn and offering it. Ga-eul lets the lantern fall, shoving Yakov forward. He grabs the urn and flees down an alley.
- Yasha and her fiends give chase.
- Yui reveals the stolen urn was a magical figment. She still holds the real one.
- Ga-eul burns a debt to summon Mizuki. They both scold her, and send her after Yakov. Mizuki sprouts demonic wings and takes chase.
- With their cover blown, Ga-eul calls [[Aiko]]. A black hummer arrives, escorting her and Yui to the [[Shoki Aspirants]]’ headquarters.
- [[Fuyu Shoki]] agrees with Yui to shelter the urn and spread the word that the [[Shoki Aspirants]] now possess it.

### Shoki Headquarters

- Yui consults [[Oki]] again—he mentions a book linked to the Ainu.
- Ga-eul shares an emotional night with Aoki, discussing her father. She drunkenly texts him.
- Mizuki accepts continued servitude to [[Shuten-doji]].
- Ga-eul seeks intel on the [[Onibaba Market]]. Yui already knows it’s real—so do others in the know.
- At her store, Yui seeks out [[Nifu]]. Nifu mocks Ga-eul by shapeshifting into her . He explains entry requires a ticket from a Hello Kitty mascot.
- At Osaka station, the mascot gives Yui and Ga-eul warded tickets.
- The group boards a blackened train, joined by a katana-wielding man named [[Goro]].
