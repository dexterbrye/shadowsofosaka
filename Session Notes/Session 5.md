Location: [[Osaka Metropolitan University]]

The group head to [[Eggleston]]'s office. Mizuki] walks through the door. Literally.

There's a letter from [[Erikson]] to [[Eggleston]] (or the other way around) saying - we are in war, whatever support we can find we must, we shall fight (Churchill references), find ourselves allies.

There's a bookcase in there that objects pass through. However if they stay inside the bookcase, they rapidly decay and rot. The gang is unable to figure out how to pass through, and leave a note for [[Eggleston]] so he knows they've been there.

Location: Hospital

Glassy eyed receptions and doctors are there. Ga-eul] gets nothing out of them.

A [[Nure-Onna]] guard approaches the group, tells them to scram. Quinn] offers to heal [[Kammu]]. He makes her fae swear. She does. They're allowed through.

Quinn] heals [[Kammu]] in return for him giving them the 411 on what happened. He tried to kick a faction out of his turf. Unfortunately they had a Necromancer (likely [[Eggleston]]). He killed them all but the necromancer, who managed to escape.

[[Kammu]] goes Yui] with a reference to [[Minako]], to try to put her off-guard.

Location: Quinn's Apartment

The [[Bloody Thorn]] is there (having been let in by [[Lora Ziegler]]). References a revolution, get out of her way. I think they owe Quinn a debt perhaps?

Quinn] asks [[Lora Ziegler]] about a [[Hachiman]]. She's heard of a shipping container and something about an auction. She offers to follow up on it, cashing in a debt with Quinn].

Location: ???

Yui] and Mizuki] head to the meeting organised by [[Erikson]]. A war council of sorts.

Lots of Latin chanting. Yui announces herself as belonging to the [[Conclave of the Dragon's Heart]] [[Conclave of the Dragon's Heart]].

[[Eggleston]] leads the meeting. Asks Yui] and Mizuki] to help them take down the vampires.

[[Eggleston]] knows about the [[Beppu Ka]].

Something wrong about the eye sitting in the middle of the taproom?

Nez asked two questions:
* How to get book? Exchange magic with him.
* ???

Lost two comrades - perished, Eggleston made it away. Police are saying Eggleston was involved. Look after. Respect their memory.

Yui] asks some questions of [[Eggleston]]
* How do I put him in debt? He's purely transactional. Immediately - spruik him up and make him look like a big deal?
* How could I get him to give up control of the taproom? If how well he's connected comes to light, it will be shattered.
* Your presence is worrying him.

Big ritual in _two days time_ when there is a full moon.

Ga-eul] is having dinner with [[Aleksandre]]. He's trying to tell her about a new job he has on security. She's fobbing him off. He tells her about a guy called 'Mitch' from Australia (who was also at the rave and met the others briefly). Ga-eul] takes some brief notes but doesn't really pay attention.

[[Aitan]] tells her to get on his side or gtfo. [[Shimmer]] is for the good of the court, and Quinn] 'isn't going to stop this menace' (???).

* Auction listing. Main thing is an artwork, China, 'powerful' about powerful deities. The sword that recasts the world.
* All set up by '[[Barnum]] Group Enterprise'
* Ogres gauntlet. Black diamond (cursed?)
* Ticketed event - Barnum sells.

Some dude wants to buy the jar. Has something pretty horrific inside it. He'll pay top dollar.

This seems to be Mizuki]'s boss [[Shuten-doji]]. Tells Yui] to pass on word through Mizuki] or drop by [[Oi-no-Saka]].

[[Nifu]] mentions that during the [[Bonsai War]], there were rumours that it was ended by bringing in a deity.
