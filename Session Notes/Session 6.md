### **The Demon Jar and Werewolf Trials**

**The Deal at Okami**

- Mizuki's partner, [[Jin]], arranges a meeting with a buyer for the demon vase at **Okami**, an Americana-themed bar.
    
- Yui notices it’s a **werewolf bar**, home to a new pack led by **[[Ama]]**, a tall, red-haired alpha.
    
- [[Ama]] demands **30% of the deal**. [[Jin]] suggests Mizuki can fight everyone.
    
- Mizuki accepts a **trial by combat** and defeats her opponent, but accidentally inflicts a **demon death curse**.
    
- Quinn heals the werewolf, gaining the pack’s **respect and admiration**, much to her chagrin.
    

**Supernatural Disturbance**

- During the bar fight, the **demon vase begins moving on its own**, dragged by an unseen force.
    
- Yui tries to stop it and gets **frostbitten** by a ghost (the child referenced in the session title).
    
- Yui turns the ghost into a snowman and reclaims the bag.
    
- Mizuki finds no master spirit outside, but the team regroups and focuses on future plans.
    

**Forging the Alliance**

- Yui makes a deal with [[Ama]]: if she finds an entry point into the [[Nure-Onna]] vampire stronghold, the **werewolves will attack**.
    
- Werewolves are likened to **pirates**—chaotic, brash, and eager to claim territory.
    
- [[Jin]] is deflated about the failed deal and reluctantly agrees to let Mizuki and Yui find another buyer.
    

**Court Intrigues and Political Moves**

- Quinn reconnects with [[Bloody Thorn]], agreeing to take down [[Aitan]]'s drug operations so long as he remains alive.
    
- [[Thorn]] sends her to [[Sergeant Moto]] for intel on drug locations.
    
- Quinn meets Moto, magically earns the trust of a flunky, and technically doesn’t lie in her report.
    

**The Beast, the Jar, and Shuten-Doji**

- Yui seeks help from [[The Beast]], but finds it **sealed in statue form**—inert and unavailable.
    
- Mizuki returns to the [[Beppu Ka]]], where [[Shuten-doji]] is **angry she used his power for personal matters**.
    
- His tone softens when he hears [[Ama]] is in town, suggesting a possible **crush**.
    
- [[Shuten-doji]] demands that Mizuki recover the demon vase. He is **not forthcoming** about why but offers to **wipe her debt** if she succeeds.
    

**The Taproom Threat**

- Yui receives a visit from [[Erikson]], who warns her that [[Eggleston]] is planning a **ritual with the Taproom of the Eye** that night.
    
- [[Eggleston|Eggleston]] doesn’t want Yui there, which signals he’s **planning something deadly**.
    
- Yui pulls a favor to learn the ritual’s location and calls in help.
    

**Breaking the Wards**

- Quinn uses a favor from [[Lora Ziegler]] to break into the literature building.
    
- Mizuki requests **extra power from [[Shuten-doji]]** to pierce [[Eggleston|Eggleston]]’s magical wards.
    

**The Confrontation**

- The group enters [[Eggleston|Eggleston]]’s **sanctum** behind a bookshelf.
    
- They find the **ritual already underway**, siphoning the life force of Taproom adherents into a **black crystalline skull**.
